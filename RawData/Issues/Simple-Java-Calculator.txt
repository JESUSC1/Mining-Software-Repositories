On macOS the JTextArea for the "text" was too wide and made it so the user could not see the numbers being inputed as they were off the frame. Also, updated button symbols with super scripts.

Hello there, I'm back :) 

I created jar file on Eclipse maven. It has pom.xml and other dependencies. Is that the one that you were asking last time? If it is not please provide some more details, so that I can learn and re-update. Thank you for time.

I have added the div and mod operators for integer numbers for #88.

Suggestion for new feature

I noticed that the calculator does not offer the modulo operation (which returns the remainder during a division of two numbers).
So, I could add this specific feature.

Issue 87 - Author: af4092
1. I've added new button for the Calculator: ln (natural logarithm)
2. I made changes on UI.java by adding:
                        line 55: butln;
                        line 105: butln = new JButton("ln"); 
                        line 141: butln.setFont(font); 
                        line 179: panelSub5.add(butln); 
                        line 213: butln.addActionListener(this); 
                        line 293-294: if (source == butln)
                                   writer(calc.calculateMono(Calculator.MonoOperatorModes.ln, reader())); 
3. Changes on Calculator.java:
                        line 26: ln;
                        line 116-117: if (newMode == MonoOperatorModes.ln) {
                                                       return log(num); }

This is the result after update:

I had a blank JFrame when running the program. I moved the JFrame.setVisible(true); down to the bottom of the init() which ended up fixing that issue. I also thought it would be nice to see the operand chosen in the text box so I added that functionality. Lastly, I added a try catch to make sure the value being passed through after an operand is a number or clear so it the program doesnt break trying to convert an operand to a Double.

When we add this service, it will count every hit of this repo. And this will guide us more about the visitors each day and will indicate the total views. For me, this is very helpful both for us and for those will view this repo seeing this page views. This can be simply added in the website also.

Good day.

The `setIconImage` will simply not work when we are dealing with a jar file, because the contents inside might not actually be located. In order to fix that

1. I added `BufferedImageCustom.java` to read the content properly and throw an exception if the file (`icon.png`) cannot be located.

2. The UI constructor, in order to accept a method that throws an exception, I added `throws IOException`.

3. The main method, in order to properly catch the exception, there should be the `try-catch` block.

4. In order to mark this, I created another release, executable jar file included,
<https://github.com/xdvrx1/Simple-Java-Calculator/releases/tag/v1.1.1>
Again, the name of this release, is up to you when you want to include this in your repo.

Thank you so much!

Users can add any text through the keyboard in the text-area field and applications stop further working. That's not comprehensive, So I put applied the function setEditable(false) on text-area to prevent any input data from the keyboard users can only hit calculator buttons to calculate the data.

# Project Proposed Changes
1. Missing `{` supplied after `if (num % 90 == 0 && num % 180 != 0)`. Others might not notice this error immediately.

2. Program icon added. But, I want my full reservation rights on this icon.

3. GUI - instead of just using the `FlowLayout`, which automatically wraps the component, I added another one: the `BoxLayout`. Unlike the `FlowLayout`, this layout preserves the spaces. And in order for me to group several components together in several rows, I added several panels, then add it later to the main panel.

4. Errors during creation of objects: the algorithm is the culprit. Objects must be created in the constructor, and the way the frame is set should be correct, for example `frame.add(panel)` should be invoked after all the contents were added first in sub panels and then in the main panel.

5. I formally created the release jar file not in the main directory, but in the provided Releases feature of GitHub.

Future changes I look forward to ...
1. Unit Tests
2. another text area to display the complete input
3. exception messages

Issue 29 - Author: jdevstatic
You forgot to put the  `{` after `if (num % 90 == 0 && num % 180 != 0)` under `calculateMono` method. It is causing errors. Others might not be able to see that there is just missing `{` there to correct the errors.

The suggested changes can be verified by running Solar Lint on Eclipse.
Further I would like to add that Standard outputs should not be used directly to log anything .
When logging a message there are several important requirements which must be fulfilled:
• The user must be able to easily retrieve the logs 
• The format of all logged message must be uniform to allow the user to easily read the log 
• Logged data must actually be recorded 
• Sensitive data must only be logged securely 

If a program directly writes to the standard outputs, there is absolutely no way to comply with those requirements. That's why defining and using a dedicated logger is highly recommended.

There is a folder called private under the nbproject folder. This folder contains private information that is machine specific and not project specific.
According to the following link:
[http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50453_01/doc.80/e50452/create_japps.htm#NBDAG2974](url)

> If the project is checked out of a version control system, the build (or nbbuild), dist (or nbdist), and the nbproject/private folders should not be checked into that version control system. If the project is under the CVS, Subversion, or Mercurial version control systems, the appropriate "ignore" files are created or updated for these directories when the project is imported. Though nbproject/private should be ignored, nbproject should be checked into the version control system. nbproject contains project metadata that enables other users to open the project in NetBeans without having to import the project first.
